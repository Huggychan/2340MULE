In case you forgot what you're doing, Shyam Bilal and Myron will work on the player
Config page, which consists of Setting name and race,

Marc and I will be doing Game, which consists of difficulty, # players, map type, color

Shyam will use case for select Plot,
Marc, Gamble
Bilal, Select #player
Myron, Difficulty,
Me, Auction
