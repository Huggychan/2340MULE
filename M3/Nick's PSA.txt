Alright so someone copied the entire directory and put it into
this directory so we had a cs2340-mule inside this cs2340-mule. Don't do that.

In case you forgot what you're doing, Shyam Bilal and Myron will work on the player
Config page, which consists of Setting name and race and color

Marc and I will be doing Game, which consists of difficulty, # players, map type

Shyam will use case for select Plot,
Marc, Gamble
Bilal, Select #player
Myron, Difficulty,
Me, Auction
